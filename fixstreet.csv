Every time the Metropole has an exhibition, there are vehicles parked all along St. Margaret's Place and Cannon, despite the fact that there are signs everywhere saying there is no loading or unloading at any time; the traffic wardens turn a completely blind eye to this situation, whilst ticketing with abandon one road up in Russell Square. The Metropole has a special loading bay which allows vehicles to reverse right into it, but they do not use it. This reduces accessible pavements in St. Margaret's Place to one side of the road, where there are numerous bicycles chained to the railings. Wheelchair users living in St. Margaret's Place or Sussex Heights are then forced onto the road, which, due to the chaotic traffic conditions caused by the Metropole, creates a very hazardous situation for both pedestrains and wheelchair users. Furthermore, the Metropole allows its fire exits to be used by traders/exhibitors for loading and unloading, which means that the fire exits are not kept clear as they are blocked with stacks of boxes and equipment.",

The owners of this small but much-loved area of open space have deliberately not maintained the land as the council have not allowed them to develop housing on it (we assume they bought it for speculative reasons). It has therefore become a haven for fly-tippers and an encouragement to vermin. During the recent storm, a mature tree snapped in two and came down over the wall of an adjoining property and is still now in their garden. The local (Tory) councillors seem to be more interested in blaming the previous Labour administration (who did actually manage to get the owners to make at least cursory attempts at maintaining the land) rather than dealing with the current situation. Nothing seems to be happening at all and things will only get worse unless the council forces the landowners to face up to their legal responsibilities to maintain the land. ",

Drivers comming off Bath Road into Oldfield Road are not made aware that there is a alley way that leads Directly onto the road as there is No pavement. This is a busy and poular crossing point for people getting in/out of Sadlers Mews/Farthingales. However because of (i) lack of pavement (ii)cars turning corner too fast without any warning notice , this is also a very dangerous crossing place when comming out of this alley onto Oldfield Road directly.

Current issue - blocked drain at chicane outside no16. Fencing and wall of council owned property (currently managed by Housing Association on behalf of CBC)been in a poor state of repair for at least a decade. Boundary wall of this property is a persistent dumping ground/garden is currently full of discarded bottes and cans, there are missing fence panels adjoining no. 16 and the NTL cable box serves as a rubbish bin (as such items of street furniture do in other neighbouring streets!)and is constantly daubed in graffiti. I understand from a council source that the future of the Military Road property may be reconsidered later this year - what consideration (if any) will be given to the views of adjoining residents about any proposed change of use? The complete inadequacy of even minimal parking (19 spaces for 24 properties) is made worse by witnessing the steady deterioration and degradation of the land surrounding the council owned property on Military Road. I am sure these problems will seem 'minor' to those who do not live here - but a poor and neglected environment has a corrosive impact on people's quality of life and health - and these are clearly not conditions that are tolerated in other more affluent parts of Colchester!

At the juntion between Seafield Road and Traill street there has been an ongoing large and extensive pothole/subsidence. Several times attempts have been made to fill the holes with loose tarmac  - this is totally ineffective and simply  comes striaght out - sometimes within 1-2 days. The traffic is both fast and heavy for this type of residential area. The dangers are several-fold: 
1) traffic swerves to avoid the holes with  the possibility of hitting oncoming traffic.
2) bicyclists and motorcyclists may end up coming off their cycles if they encounter the pothole it is that severe.
3) The loose chippings resulting from the inadequate repairs are being flung up to about 3-4 ft high as traffic passes - often at speeds >30 mph. This traffic is particulary prevalent in the mornings when there are numerous school children using the pavements. I wonder how long it will be before a child is injured.

The council should endeavour to effect the immediate repair of this problem in a more appropriate way for the long-term safety of road users and pedestrians.",

Since the pipe work of Thames Water (within last 2 months) in the smaller section of Woodside Park (next to Woodside House) - the grounds all around has been water logged. No doubt a pipe is leaking beneath the ground wasting untold amounts of water (that we pay for!).

All the paving stones on the public pathway round this small green are broken and some are graffitied. It provides for hazardous walking and myself and my little girl have both tripped up. Also, as the entire Worton Estate was repaved over the last couple of years, I dont see why this part was left out. Please can we have new paving stones round the green, for health and safety reasons and because it looks out of keeping with the rest of the estate. Thank you.",

Close to London Fields there is a railway bridge # 1356BGK that crosses over Exmouth Place.
Unlike all the other nearby bridges, this one does not have either netting or concrete to prevent pigeons nesting underneath.
As a result the footpath and road is constantly covered in pigeon droppings, presenting both a health risk and an eyesore.
This is cleaned up irregularly, sometimes only as a result of a call to Hackney street cleaning services.
In order to get netting or concrete added to the underside of the bridge to prevent this problem, I assume that Hackney Council must contact Railtrack and make a request for this to be done.
If Railtrack refuse to do this, they can then be taken to court to effect action (as has been done by other London Councils).

I have noticed over the last few months and increasing number of cars parking on the grass verges along this road and also adjacent to the playing fields. The area is a NO parking zone, and double yellow lines are clearly there! The cars a wrecking the grass and breaking curbs. Clearly on the map is a car park which is always half empty so parking in the area is an issue. I would suggest a police man goes there and writes out 20 or 30 warnings to move the cars!",

    ","    Sent to Dudley Borough Council 59 minutes later
    ","
This issue has been reported to Dudley Council Plus since June 2006 and is still unresolved.
The lights at this junction are 3 way - 1 way for traffic travelling up and down the Broadway/Castle Hill, 1 way for traffic travelling down Castle St onto the Broadway/Castle Hill and a 3rd way for traffic leaving The Fellow's restaurant/pub.
Since Early 2006 the car sensing equipment which detects vehicles waiting to turn out of The Fellow's restaurant has been faulty. So the council have set the phasing to allow The Fellow's restaurant exit to have a green light phase after the two other phases have taken place. As a result each phase of the lights now encorporates a turn for vehicles exiting the restaurant, even when there are no vehicles there (i.e. before 11am or after 11pm). The result of this is that for 30 seconds of each phase of the traffic lights all traffic remains stationary - causing a build-up of traffic on a main throughfare of Dudley.
There also appears to be no traffic sensing equipment on the other two entrances to this junction and as a result traffic is stopped by a Red light, when there is no traffic coming from the other road.

There is an ever increasing amount of spray paint on walls signs and the new skate park that was built.
On a weekend Friday and Saturday nights Idle village centre (The Green), Railway Road and the recreation ground we get groups of nuisance youths hanging around and throwing stones at houses causing trouble at the pizza shop on The Green, they then move down Railway Road, and into the recreation ground. This is causing distress for local residents and shop keepers.
I have spoken to the owners of the pizza shop and they have stated that people are scared to come into the shop and purchase goods due to these youths as there is a regular gathering of 20-30 youths.
Very rarely do we see attention being paid to this area by the PCSO’s. In the four years that I have lived here I have seen the PCSO’s twice in the area.
We have had several wheelie bins stolen from the New Street and Railway Road area 6 black recycle bins and two green waste bins have been stolen. This has been reported to the council however we are still awaiting new ones, this was reported well over six months ago and the forms were sent out and filled in by myself and a neighbour and sent back to the council.

This is caused by a 'flap' on the side wall by the river not closing, mainly because of rubbish and vegetation stopping it from shutting properly.",

The park needs to be cleaned on a daily basis, it is a public space, there is a constant stream of people who pass through to gain access to the family planning clinic, the high street, the station and the childrens playground. The paving has a pure guano covering because of the old ladies who dump piles of breadcrumbs to feed the filthy pidgeons. The rubbish bins are always full and in the wrong place, they need to be next to the benches (common sense!). Why isn't there a plastic bag recycling facility, people bring their bottles to recycle in plastic bags then they dump the plastic bags in the rubbish???  Why can't they recycle the bags as well?

""Due to the fire that destroyed Pleasurama there is urgent need for a new development below the cliff where it was. This is a very challenging and difficult project for an architect, not only do the surroundings mean he has a lot to live up to but the site has two problems not often encountered in building projects. One being that the building is viewed from above meaning it will have to look attractive from an unusual direction and will be a target to any vandal who throws an object from the cliff top. The other is the flood line, as well as the probable effects of global warming, because Ramsgate it situated where two tidal systems converge, that of the English Channel and that of the North Sea. A combination of spring sides and high winds occasionally causes exceptionally high tides, if there is a storm as well, flooding can happen very quickly indeed. The last time this happened was about 20 years ago, fortunately it was a calm day and only a few carpets were damaged.

I  have to negotiate around these vehicles out onto the road in a disabled wheelchair as do parents with children in buggies. The line of parked cars often stretches as far along as Danebury Avenue.",

Cars travelling from East to West (Westmount Road to Well Hall Road) over the speed hump outside number 111 Dunvegan Road often scrape the underbodies of their cars on the tarmac on the West side of the hump. There is terrible damage to the road surface and to the cars that have scraped it! I don't see why drivers should have to slow down to 5mph in order to travel over a 20mph hump without damaging their cars... Please can this be looked at?",

This area used to be a pleasant cycling and walking route but has in the last year become a real eyesore strewn with litter, glass and broken fences. Until recently a man was even living in a tent in the undergrowth. When I walk my dog I ALWAYS see several rats running around without a care and my dog regularly cuts his paws on the broken glass. The nearby Kebab van and Morrisons Supermarket are of course the source of much of the rubbish but someone needs to clean it up on an ongoing basis. Please can the council urgently do something to restore this area and resolve what has become a dangerous public health nuisance.",

I am writing with two road issues to alert someone to the potential danger on the stretch of road called Broomhouse lane which runs at the back of school row near adderlane school  The cut which takes people from Towneley Court over this road into School row has a very steep incline and overgrown bushes make visibility difficult.  Cars speed down here all day and it wont be long before someone gets injured or worse.  there needs to be traffic calming down this route to slow cars down and visibility needs to be improved.  The road comes out into the main Castlefields estate sandwiched between two traffic calming obstacles on Castlefields road, these obstacles  are both unneccessary and dangerous in their current position as cars come out on a blind bank and have right of access on one set of obstacles and then need to give way on the other, with little space between.  This is very confusing and I feel that the calming obstacles either need to be moved or removed.  ",

The Old A34 was used as a rat-run when the Newbury Bypass was being constructed. The road took a severe pounding from the amount of heavy traffic using it on a daily basis. The road now has a 7.5 tonne weight limit, which is largely ignored by the heavy traffic en-route to the Red Shute Hill area. The road has also recently been narrowed, to accomodate 15 new houses, and is in need of repair along the whole of its length, from where it meets Priors Court Road to Beedon Hill, which has already been resurfaced.

The road has many potholes,  the surface eroded by frost, the tarmac pavement very uneven and dangerous to walk on. When some holes are cosmetically filled in, they are soon dangerous again.

currently out to consultation with the statutory consultees, after which

On most weekdays, cars are parked right up to the junction between Queensgate Road and Station Approach Road, on both sides of Queensgate Road. These seem to belong to commuters using Ramsgate Railway Station - there is less of a problem at weekends.
Coming out of Queensgate Road can be tricky enough without visibility along Station Approach Road being blocked in this way.
Last year double yellow lines were painted around other corners of this crossroads; indeed the northern side of the crossroads has had hard landscaping to improve matters. When can we expect something similar in Queesngate Road?

At my home my neighbour and i have a public footpath going through the front of our property, we are really getting fed up. People are coming through, throwing rubbish, lit cigarrette ends and everything in our front gardens i have even had my bin set on fire by children. We are forever fixing our front gates, as people are just breaking them of. This is annoying for me as i have young children and they cannot even go out in their front garden to play (we live on a main road) because of these gates i am worried about the road. My husband,neighbour and i keep going to the council but nothing is being done. We are really getting fed up with this.  I am also  getting dogs and cats coming into the front garden and fouling my grass and pathway.

I live in Brooklyn Road and am sick of seing the top part of the road around the council houses in perfect condition, while all the way down the surface should have been redone. 
The potholes at bottom end of the road after the mini roundabout keep being refilled appallingly, creating bumps instead of holes whoch are then of course shaven off by the traffic and make the holes bigger. Nothing is being done for the largest part of the road.
I was not going to report anything until I twisted my anlke because of a huge pothole while crossing the road in front of my house. I had my 3 year old in my arms and I am nearly 6 months pregnant. Had a car been closer, this could have been tragic. If my ankle does not get better soon, I will consider taking this much further as I cannot take appropriate medication because of my pregnancy.
Please resurface the whole of Brooklyn Road and place traffic calming while you're at it, or a speed camera if the council needs funding, income would be garanteed.",

Over the past 12 months since moving into the property we have experienced lots of problems with people using the footpath which leads from Fisher close onto Carsic road. The footpath itself is being used as a dog toilet and a litter bin, it is full of rubbish and broken bottles.Most of the fence panels have been damaged or graffited on. Also on 4 seperate occations over the past year i have witnessed humans urinating in the footpath.People are also riding illegal motor bikes through the footpath on a regular basis, all the times that i have witnessed this the riders havent once been wearing a helmet. Children who live on our street often play close to the footpath and with motorbikes being ridden through the footpath, it is a accident waiting to happen. People using the footpath are also using the garden on the side of my property as a dog toilet and litter bin aswell. I have also had to replace my outside light, next to my front door which has been smashed. On replacing it, the light lasted a total of two nights before it was smashed once again. Im not bothering to replace it this time, it will only get damaged again!! Over the past 12 months We have also had plants stolen from the side of front door  and things put through our letter box on a number of occasions. Kids also keep knocking on our door and running off through the footpath. The footpath is making our lives a misery and we are considering moving home. Talking to other residents on the street they feel the same as we do. We all cannot see the purpose of the footpath, im sure people would rather walk the road way than put up with all the trouble the footpath causes. Thankyou for taking the time to read this.     ",

Lowlands Close is a small cul de sac off a cul de sac,Peregrine Way, the two roads are congested with residential parking, approx every other weekend and about 3 nights during the week a large breakdown lorry is being parked mainly in Lowlands Close or in Peregrine Way if it is too busy in Lowlands Close, this lorry is never parked outside the house of the person who brings it home even though he has a lay-by outside.  This lorry can be called away at all hours and is very loud when started up, pulling away and parking, with the summer months coming it is going to be impossible to have windows open at night because of the noise.  I feel that where the lorry is left on certain evenings would be an obstruction for the emergency services as it is sometimes a tight fit for a car to get past.  Most nights it parks in Lowlands Close directly opposite a residents car park entrance thus making it difficult for some vehicles to access this car park, it also blocks the view and makes it awkward for people using their drives. As with most small roads the area is showing an increase in commercial vans parking but I do feel that a breakdown lorry is just too big for a small residential cul de sac.",

On 30th March 2007, I went riding with a friend. It was the first time I’d ridden out on the mare I recently purchased. My friend (a far more experienced horsewoman than I am) volunteered to accompany me, in case the mare turned out to be nervous on the road. While riding past a property called ‘Whitegates’ in Station Road, Gedney Hill, I remarked how my horse had quickly got over her panic about the white stones around its driveway exit. My mare had just moved from the road onto the grass verge, presumably because of discomfort since still unshod. I then became aware of someone shouting, and turned back to see a woman waving from a bungalow window on my left and yelling, “Get off our grass!”

I have lived in Quorn for over 20 years and saw the building of the A6 bypass.  I live in Huntsmans Close.  Over the 10 years that the bypass has been in place the traffic level has increased and with it the noise level.  Over this Easter weekend the noise level of fast cars and motor bikes on the A6 was constant from 0830am to 1030pm on every day of the bank holiday weekend.  The noise level has increased and is clearly audible now in the house which has double glazing.  In comparison to other bypasses (Rearsby, Mountsorrel A6 section and others) there is an obvious lack of bunding and planting on the A6 section from Proctors Pleasure Park to the end of the A6 roundabout at 3 Ashes.  Can you please confirm any action that is underway to correct this; any monitoring of traffic flows; any monitoring of noise levels (peak, off peak etc).  This noise is having a profond environmental effect on our area in Quorn and is detracting from any pleasure there is in spending time in our garden and surrounding area.",

Regular fly tipping takes place because Alice ThompsonClose is served by 4 large ""wheely bins"". Cars have been seen dumping general waste into the bins and quite often large items are dumped by non residents. At present, a settee, fridge, set of doors, childs buggy etc have been dumped in the past two days. Could I suggest that residents are issued with individual ""wheely bins"" and then remove the 4 large bins. This would highlight to non residents that Lewisham will not remove rubbish from that area unless within individual bins?",

We backing onto Thorold Road, Ilford, IG1 4HB are fed up as we have a enviromental problem with the ever increase rubbish ending up in our gardens from 178, 180, 182 & 184 regularly dumping refuse/household rubbish, rubble, furniture, etc, etc... None of these properties surprisingly do not have fencing and have open access which enables them to dump their rubbish easily.

When you turn left the footpath then goes under an elevated platform and stairs, which is access to my neighbours house. It is dark on an evening and you cannot see. Along this footpath there is a rectangular cover on a drain which is loose and has holes in due to rusting over the years. You cannot avoid stepping on it as the path is narrow. There is also a leeking pipe on the wall of one of my neighbours house that constantly  drips water onto the pavement.Thus the pavement is very slippery.We have asked him to do something about this but he never has.

A man keeps grey hounds, several of them, and when they are taken out in packs for walks, they mess everywhere, and it really smells.

My house backs onto a public footpath that is used by literally hundreds of people each week to get between Hallam Way and Station Road (inc West Hallam Community Centre).  Since moving in (5 years ago) I have repeatedly had the fence that I installed at the bottom of my garden vandalised.  I have fixed the fence on three occasions now, only to see it vandalised again within a few weeks.  This not only presents me with the problem of security and a lack of privacy but also puts other innocent users of the footpath at risk (particularly younger children) from exposed nails and splintered wood etc. etc.  I have now reached the point where there is no point fixing the fence again.  I have reported the problem to the police who have visited and said that they will monitor the situation (which particularly arises on Friday evenings, with large gangs of teenagers hanging around on the footpath).  Whilst I can see the benefit of the footpath to all users(I myself used to use it a lot in my younger days) I fail to see why I should continue to invest my time and money in maintaining a fence that is going to be repeatedly vandalised anyway and would now happily campaign against closing the footpath altogether!  I would ask that the council consider my case and help to provide a solution.  The footpath is now a complete mess with overgrown plants, broken fences with wood strewn everywhere and grafitti.  Please help.",

I regularly visit Bransty play park with my children and was disgusted to see that the bridge across the climbing frame was damaged and dangerous. The most shocking thing of all was that the only thing to stop the children from crossing this very dangerous bridge was a bit of hazard tape. Surely if the council knew about this you would have made it more secure until a time that it could be fixed properly. I would also like to add that the general state of the apparatus is poor and is in need of repair or replacement. I understand that this is probably a money issue but the play park is an important part of the Bransty community and there for should be maintained properly.",

Over the past few months there has been a massive increase in the playing of  ball games on the green area in Hawthorn Road.What started as a couple of lads kicking a football around has snowballed into 12-15 children and adults constantly playing a variety of games,from football(complete with portable goal and lager drinking spectators)to cricket.These activites sometimes go on until 9.00pm or later,especially at the weekends.several months ago I had one of my living room windows smashed by a golf ball,although the damage was repaired by the father of the boy responsible.I feel it is only a matter of time before we will once again be sweeping up the glass from another broken window.within the last five minutes (8.50pm)a football has  thumped twice very hard against our front door again.
I have also noticed that the ""NO BALL GAMES"" sign has mysteriously disapeared.

As a resident of the north side of Ilkley, I often used to walk down through Mill Ghyll or the ‘Woods Walk’ as some know it on my way down into town. Nowadays I avoid this route as the area has become what can only be described as a haunt for drug peddlers. 
On many occasions I have seen kids as young as thirteen obviously taking and pushing drugs in there. Recently as I walked through I saw two lads approach a bench, look underneath then give a disgruntled exclamation of ‘It’s not there’ before kicking the bench. The anger shown by these youths at  (I presume) not having found their stash where it was hidden or dropped off was quite intimidating and it cannot be coincidence that very few people take this route anymore.
This is not to say that the problem is entirely down to ‘rough’ kids who cause trouble elsewhere. I have seen offspring of various well to do families shiftily entering the Ghyll, blatantly looking for a way to quite literally ‘blow’ their pocket money. Drug dealers must see this as a perfect market; kids with a load of money, nothing to do and a police force who do nothing about it.
So I appeal to our police officers to investigate the matter, solve the problem however they see fit and make Mill Ghyll a pleasant stroll to and from town again.

As a family we regularly use the facilities near to the village hall, every time we go there is an increasing amount of broken glass. My husband and I have tried to pick some of it up but there is far, far too much for 2 people to keep up with. We are becoming increasingly scared to use the facilities, due to the danger to ours selves and the children. This problem is not isolated to this area the childrens play areas at millmoor avenue and upper lodge road are in the same state. We are not sure what the solution could be but would be willing to participate in any way possible.
Thank you",

I am not alone in my road in trying to recycle kitchen scraps in the compost bin but this is encouraging rats.  It really goes against my ethics to put these scraps in the dustbin when they could so easily be recycled but the rats are a very real and now visible problem which is only going to get worse.  If we had brown wheelie bins for kitchen scraps this would effectively reduce the rat population as they would have nothing to feed on.

On finishing her tenancy our tenant said she had been plagued by the estates teenagers playing football outside, and using our garage as goal. Since she left there has to date been three incidents of damage to the guttering and drainpipe at the front of the house. These have been replaced. The front garden is obviously being used as a football pitch and my garage as a goalpost. On the second occasion I reported the matter to the police, received an interview via telephone and was given a crime number and a follow up letter saying why I had not received a police visit and the matter had been placed on file. Last thursday, 12/4/07 whilst fitting new drainpipe my husband noticed the guttering above the garage was damaged and the whole length would need replacing. I once again reported it to the police at Newton Aycliffe office and was told to go home and someone would come out to interview me. Home is Hamsterley. That afternoon a police officer visited the house from Bishop Auckland, took details gave me yet another crime reference number and explained he would send a report to Newton Aycliffe. I dread visiting the house, as it is in the process of being sold and will be empty for at least another six weeks. There is another empty house at entrance to the estate which is vandal free. Why can nothing be done about these teenagers? It seems as long as they are out of the house and not damaging their property or bothering them the parents don't care what they get up to. Where are the street wardens and the bobby on the beat? My husband and I feel that our hands are tied. If you see them playing football all you receive is a mouthful of abuse and if you take the law into your own hands you end up in trouble. I know children have a right to play, but I am describing the actions of older children/teenagers who know the difference between right and wrong. A neighbour whose children are adult did inform my husband that he tries to stop the teenagers playing football. Coverdale court is supposedly in a neighbourhood watch area. ",

Members of public put rubbish in bins.  Overnight, crows enter the bins, drag out litter & wind spreads it over large area.

I am writing with reference to the numerous parking obstructions which happen in Lintly, Wilnecote, whenever a football match takes place.

We are aware that this will not be the first email that has been sent to the Tamworth Borough Council, as our neighbours have been doing the same.

Adjacent to our house, is the entrance to two fields which are used for football games by younger children on one pitch, and adults on the other.

I must make it clear, that we have no objection to anyone playing football on these pitches, and to be honest, the adult matches do not cause us a problem, as they have been advised to use the parking facilities on the opposite side of the pitches, by the Stoneydelph shopping area.

However, our issue appears to be a problem with the brainless parking of the parents of the children, and their general disregard for road safety, or public access for any of the local residences.

As residents, we all park on the one side of the street to allow vehicular access to the rest of the street, should cars be parked on both sides of the street, problems arise.

Parents have taken to parking on the apexes of corners, causing larger vehicles problems when turning the corner, and to parking opposite residents parked cars, causing a restriction to any vehicle that may wish to reach the bottom of the street.

Lintly has one entrance, and this is also the exit, so when cars are forced to squeeze through gaps which have been caused by inconsiderate parking, then problems arise.

If the emergency services were to need access, on most occasions, this would not be possible.

As for pedestrians, again rights of way are blocked.

We have spoken to the local Police on almost 18 occasions, beginning in the summer of last year. In that time, we have received a single visit!

The Police officer said that she would speak to some of the parents in attandance at the time, but would also try to speak to the organisation who arranges the matches.

Now, we do not know which organisation oversses these matches, or whom to contact, hence our email to you.

I would be grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this email, and confirm that you will look into this matter, urgently, before a problem is caused to someone on this street who cannot get assistance when an emergency arises.",

During evenings and weekends there are vehicles parked in such a way as to make this junction extremely hazourdous.

At least 3 white vans park either side of the road right up to the entrance/exit of Vernon Road, obscuring any vision eiting or entering said Road. The residents have questioned several times that the legality of this parking is in doubt but no one of council authority seems to be bothered to come and check this problem. 
Not only is Vernon Road used by traffic, 
(sometimes fast),trying to avoid Framfield Road it is also a bus route for the elderly and should any delivery lorries attempt to negotiate this corner then I dread to think of the havoc that might cause.

At the begining of Harbut Road,off Plough Road,at number 136 and virtually opposite the Indulgence Beauty parlour, is a private parking area where there are some broken bin stores. This area contains some really unpleasant rubbish and attracts fly tipping. There is evidence of rats and other vermin scattering the contents. 
I have hightlighted this to the council on previous occasions. Although the rubbish is collected it re-appears almost immediately because the owners of the property (possibly a housing association) are not contactd with a view to repairing the bin store, placing signs about no fly tipping or prosecuting the owners. Simply collecting the rubbish when there is a complaint ( whilst helpful) will not solve the problem without more assertive action by Wandsworth Council. ",

Despite previous notification to the local authority - details attached - potholes are still present and recent street light reinstatement works and transco reinstatement works have resulted in cracked slabs in pavement and a mis match of tarmac and pavings of various levels.  The road is heavily used as a thoroughfare for a primary school and accidents are waiting to happen.  Recently potholes have been filled with tarmac only for the tarmac to come loose within days.  I attach recent correspondence to the local authority below - Solution is for pavements to be wholely replaced with tarmac and road should be resurfaced - The whole road looks as though a bomb has hit it !!!!- even utility markings are still present - There is no difference between these marking and grafitti.

Traffic still thunders through our village despite the installation of a warning light at one end.  It is only a matter of time before somebody is killed as a result of the constant high speed of traffic.  Last Wednesday evening a series of motorcyclists rode through the village at a speed that I estimated to be in excess of 100mph.  It would appear that the only drivers who observe the 30mph limit are`those that live locally.  It would be perfectly feasible and cost effective to employ traffic effective calming measures - road narrrowing, mini roundabouts, and speed cameras as an absolute minimum.  However, the council would appear to consider that the swift movement of traffic on this road is more important than the observation of law and the protection (and quality) of life and property.",

The main sewer in Station Road has been overflowing liquid into this busy road for at least two weeks. As this is on a hill, and is also being spread by passing vehicles, a wide area of the road is affected. The smell is appalling, and the hapless pedestrian or cyclist risks being sprayed with this running excrement by passing vehicles. Despite inspections, nothing positive has yet happened, and this now I would suggest poses a serious risk to public health.

There continues to be substantial volume of 40tonne or similar  lorries, together with large coaches which regularly have severe difficulty negotiating the sharp bend from Cherry Lane into Elm Tree Road (and then often turn back into Cherry Lane, apparently to return towards the M6).
Cherry Lane is patently an unsuitable road for heavy traffic - hence the restriction sign.
There can be no reason for such traffic to use this road to reach any part of Warrington and similarly, there are ways using more suitable roads (A50/A556) for traffic going to Altrincham.
It probably appears on maps to represent a short cut and no doubt satellite navigation systems don't recognise the weight restriction.

Visiting Bandon Hill cemetery on 21/4/07 I found car access to the graves area denied. As semi disabled and aged 77 I found this unacceptable as I wished to visit two sets of family graves distant from each other.In addition,  I observed a old woman,obviously much older than myself, having to move extremely slowly using two sticks as she returned to the car park. I consider the barring of vehicles inconsistent with the current national policy of providing access for the elderly and disabled to public or semi public facilities. In the case of this  cemetery barring cars serves no conceivable security purpose - as obviously the gates are open - and in no way could it be imagined that traffic density within invited congestion charging. There were about three families in total in the whole area. I invite the appropriate authorities to reconsider their policy.

The hedges and banks alongside the pavements on the Old Portsmouth Road (particularly opposite the Gym and Kitchen Centres)are in dire need of being cut back to enable the full width of the pavement to be used. In the current state, walking along that pavement is like putting your life into your own hands (or that of passing motorists hurtling by at speed, rather). The banks need digging back further to provide a wider walkway. The overgrown hedgerows are a menace too. This pavement seems to be used quite frequently by people taking out disabled youngsters in pushchairs, and it must be exceptionally hard for them, as well as dangerous. Please can the Highways Dept cut back the hedges AND the banks to give us the maximum width of the pavement to use please? It's a busy road along there and us pedestrians need a safe pavement to use.

I write on behalf of the residents of Milkwell Gardens, Woodford Green, IG8 7BX.
For the past three and a half years, (probably a lot more), I (and some neighbours) have been trying to get the London Borough of Redbridge to sweep our road on a regular basis. 
To quote Redbridge Councils own booklet, “We will clean all of the residential roads maintained by the council at least once a week”, and since they take a compulsory charge for doing this, I would be grateful if they would.
Despite two promises of action so far this year, nothing has been done. The stock answer is ""Your road is not on the computer"".
It was adopted in about 1937 by Wanstead and Woodford Urban District Council, (later London Borough of Redbridge) but Redbridge street cleansing dept. are unable or unwilling to put us on ""the computer"".
The bin men, gardeners, lighting and drains departments etc. all appear to know where we are, and serve us well.
Please can we have our street swept, and three months accumulated litter and leaves and broken branches (from the January gales!!) removed.

The flying of St. George's flag yesterday, on the new and ostentatious flagpole erected last year, was clearly appropriate.  It was a great shame that it could not be flown from the main flagpole however, but only from one of the 3 subsidiary hoists.
This was, of course, due to the fact that the halliard for the main pole was allowed to run free through the pulley by the ""button"" presumably due to incompetent working by council staff.
Does the council plan to rectify this matter so that the (presumably expensive) flagpole can work properly?
This may not be a simple matter as the flagpole appears to have been erected in such a way that it cannot easily be lowered flat for maimtenance.  However such blatant evidence of council incompetence would be best cleared up one feels.",

Cars parking on the pavement at this corner (and other corners along Sewell Close) mean that you have to drive ""blind"" when taking the corners as you cannot see if anything is coming in the opposite direction.  Also, the car owners seem to think the pavement is their private parking space and it is not unusual to have to walk in the road because of this.  Parking in Sewell Close has been reported before to the Police and the Traffic Department at the Council and nothing is ever done about it.  Will it take an car accident of the death of a child having to walk in the road before something is done?",

The car parking at the bottom of Bramhope Green is causing chaos. It won't be long before a child going to school or an elderly person is injured in some way. Cars are parking all over the road and not considering anybody else. The council have recently put markings on the road to try and stop it, but it doesn't seem to be working. Also, residents and visitors are parking at the end of the paths and causing mothers with pushchairs & elderly people to have to walk on the grass. Something needs to be done. ",

The Stoke Road as you leave Cobham directly to drive to Fetcham is the worst of many very poor roads in Elmbridge. Please do not hide behind the fact new pipelines are being laid. The holes and broken down surface is unbelievable. When potholes are fixed, edges and parts of the potholes are ignored. There are triangular holes which are deep, there are broken down surfaces and a totally inadequate remedial situation may /may not exist. I have seen better roads in Africa. The company or Elmbridge men who do any kind of 'fixing' of the roads must produce the worst/lowest performance possible.Elmbridge should be ashamed. There are many more roads which damage tyres, and cause accidents to cyclists - look at Blundel Lane on the Oxshott side of the railway crossing, and at Littleheath Lane and so on. Malpractice of the worst kind is in evidence here.I have never seen roads anywhere else in the country which are in such a poor condition.",

The pavements in Boyne Road and nearby St Stephens Grove (the route I walk daily to Lewisham High Street) are obstructed by the council's bins which some residents do not return to within their property's boundaries, and also (in St Stephens Grove) by some residents' refuse. They are a great nuisance and they spoil the appearance of the area (a conservation area.) Regrettably I have failed to obtain remedy by writing to the council direct or by making this complaint at public meetings. The response I have always had has been that my complaint is valid and will be addressed, but it never has been. Part of the problem, I believe, is that the council's own refuse collectors leave the (emptied) bins on the pavements and do not return them to within residents' property boundaries as they are supposed to do.",

    ","
In May 2005 Thanet District Council erected a ""temporary"" barrier along the clifftop at Wellington Crescent.  The reason given was that clifftop was unsafe. It was thus strange that he barrier was erected within 1 metre of the existing fence which still (2 years later) appears to be in excellent condition. This barrier consists of 67 panels, each 3.5 metres long, and therefore extends for some 235 metres along the clifftop - over 250 yards. It is extremely unsightly and has been the subject of complaint by residents for over 12 months now. The only action taken by the council has been to remove protest signs fixed by the local Residents' Association. This only took TDC a week to do, unlike the 2 years of inaction to address the real (or imagined) problem. The barrier panels are being hired, with taxpayers money, from HERAS Readyfence Service (Tel. 0844 472 0011) and it would be reassuring to know that there is no connection between this company and the council.

please can you help on an issue with the bodwenarth quarry at silverhill close.The people who use this quarry who are the Cosslet group have no regard for the residents who live in close proximity to this place which i can only describe as a dumping ground and a temporary home for all kinds of rubbish. There is noise on a daily basis as the workers there play with their heavy machinery and move waste around the site and decant and load skips when the weather is good and there is nothing better to do.
When i moved into my house i was told the quarry was only to be used as a depot for machines but now it has turned into a dumping ground for cosslet.these machines and the huge lorries that transport then are often on the go as early as 0600hrs in the week and on weekends.",

The former Linthorpe Assembly Rooms building is in the process of being redeveloped by a local property developer. Whilst I applaud the attempt to give a local eyesore a much needed face-lift, I and other Linthorpe residents are becoming increasingly concerned by the nuisance caused by the Union Jaxx bar that comprises part of the ground floor of the Assembly Rooms building.

For example, on Sunday 15th April 2007, the warm sunshine attracted a large crowd of merry revellers who were keen to take advantage of Union Jaxx’s open aspect and loud music. It appears that one eye-(and ear)-sore has simply been replaced by another. Large numbers of inebriated individuals were obstructing the pavement in front of the premises and shattering the peace of an otherwise tranquil spring afternoon. I would suggest that Union Jaxx is in breach of its alcohol license in permitting customers to consume alcohol off the premises.

This park area has a substantial problem with litter. Tin cans, plastic bottles, cardboard etc. The ponds which have ducks in them have rubbish floating in them. This is an accumulation over a long period of time and is a health hazard as well as aesthetically displeasing. Litter extends to the verges which run along Back Lane. I have removed some of the litter myself but the site really needs a conserted effort to clear. ",

Could be a danger to children who play there or people walking dogs as well as being unsightly. Also it sets a precedent that this is the place to dump rubbish !Thanks !",

Kimpton place is a small road just off off a main A road = Gartson Lane.
It is not a cul D sac or one way road, however there are some residents of this road who allow their young children of 4yrs and up to cycle and play all over the road up and down in all directions paying no attention to traffic flow or high way code, they treat it like a private road & race track.
As a car driver and  resident i know that they will be there and expect them to be in the road so im looking out for them. I have to stop in the middle of the road to allow the kids to get out of the way, move there bikes and scooters before i can drive along, however this is a normal road used by car drivers who are not going to be aware of the situation. I am very concerned that these children are left un supervised to play out side and it is simply an accident waiting to happen.
The residents of this road whom own cars have expressed their concerns to the parents only to be confronted with aggresive behavior and swearing. 
Less than 2 mins away is garston park yet they choose to allow the children to play in the road. Do these parents not want to see there children reach adult hood! This must be stopped before it is fatel.",

I have lived in Mallard Way, Moreton for 5 years and drive a car. The most infuriating aspect of driving down TownMeadow Lane is the Junction mentioned above.
Residents regularly park their cars over a distance or 50/60 meters on a very tight bend there. It is a very narrow road at the best of times.
Here are the problems it causes
1. Poor traffic on the main TownMeadow stretch. If two vehicles take the space at the same time, they pass very narrowly in that section where cars are parked. This causes traffic to slow down to a slow pace and no doubt has caused many Minor/Medium accidents.
2. Cars from Moreton shops side 'race' at speed round the lead parked car (which is on their side of the road), regularly causing cars already passing the parked cars to slow/swerve/stop. It's a nightmare and stressful. 
3. Aggressive/Poor drivers 'force' cars coming from the chipshop side to pull into the Wastdale junction a little (and even brake suddenly). This could cause problems for traffic coming from Wastdale.
4. Traffic at Wastdale Junction can get 'stuck' on the Junction and have to pull back a little when they see two cars passing. Their view of the road is already poor.
5. That section has bus traffic. Buses passing cause increased problems, with cars having to pull in at Wastdale. When Buses park at the bus stop, all cars are stuck. If aggressive drivers try to overtake, this causes potential accidents/swerving.
6. Cars who pull out of the chipshop lane (across from Burton Road) can cause increased risks of accident.
7. Emergency traffic, fire engine, police and ambulance vehicles all have problems at that stretch.

There has for a considerable time been the debris from the water companies works in the Treowen areas dumped on this piece of land adjoining my property.

This is a residential area not a rubbish tip and it is encouraging others to flytip garden waste etc here!

I find this wholey unacceptable for many reasons- It is now located in the middle of a grassy area, not next to a footpath.  It is obtrusive.  There is another dog waste bin located only a few feet away, then not another for some time on the 'planets' estate.  Recently, I have had dog fecal matter thrown at my home from the overflowing bin.  I would ask that the bin is moved further to its original position.  The photo is as taken from my bedroom window.

Mount Ephraim Lane is closed off at both ends and there is no exit through Woodfield Grove.There is a lot of traffic that comes either from the east off Streatham High Road or from the west off Garrards Road.A number of these motorists are unfamiliar with the way through this maze of blocked off roads and need all the direction they can get. The signing at the lower part of Mount Ephraim Lane has a single dead-end sign and even the direction this points in looks like it could be Kingscourt Road that is closed off. Motorists are already frustrated by the time they come down Mount Ephraim Lane, driving at speed, only to encounter a barrier at the end. Their resulting annoyance invariably results in them returning at great speed, often in reverse gear! This part of the road, through the presence of a traffic barrier looks deceptively traffic free. Consequently it is used by a number of people for teaching their children to learn to ride a bike. The risk posed to these children by frustrated motorists needs no explanation. The danger could easily be avoided through clearer signing, preferably on both sides of the entrance to this part of the road.Ths is not just an occassional occurrence. The other day I had to explain to four motorists who arrived at the dead end all in succession! This has already been raised on three separate occassions with Lambeth Council since March but as yet still no action!",

The problem is confounded by a small layby with room for 4 vehicles regurlarly having people parking across it. This means only 3 or 2 people can park there. With parking such a premium, the loss of a single space makes a significant difference to residents.

This is also a problem with Derby Street behind Kebabish, Alis and Rukshmanis takeaways, where rats are entering buildings and leaving their feaces where young people have access. Behind pritty much most takeaways on Derby Street you have a serious and scary problem.

There Have in the past few weeks been people coming to the doors in this street and in this area begging. I'm assuming they are part of a group of beggers as they have a printed, laminated card written in english, which they pass to you at the door which is asking you for money. They all have this same card with the same words on it. I think that begging is illegal. Either way It isn't nice when strangers are coming to your door in this manner, and if you actually give them some money they will not go away.

There is a lot of vegetation both sides of Blind Lane that is encroaching onto this narrow road.  It is difficult for pedestrians who have to walk along the edge of this road, especially when vehicles are driving down it.  Could the owners of properties be asked to cut back the vegetation?  Some of it is in the small field behind an empty house on Boroughbridge Road, which I believe is in the hands of the solicitors.

Over the years that I have lived here, I have witnessed this pleasant green area, with its beautiful Horse Chestnut tree, decorative Boothville signpost, and at this time of year, a place of Remembrance for our war dead (the local parish hold a Remembrance Sunday service, & place poppies here) become a car park. Most of the people that park there on a daily basis work in the shops & businesses across the road. However, many of their customers also park there. In addition to this, many drivers can now be seen driving across the green, rather than queuing to get out on to the Kettering Road - very dangerous. In wet weather the green is churned up by these vehicles, and now it looks very unsightly. To add to this more and more cars are appearing with ‘For Sale’ signs on them.     
After numerous telephone calls to N'pton CC, no action has been forthcoming.
The placement of wooden bollards around the green would solve this problem. Please can we see some action?

Most evenings,Friday and Saturday being the worst times.  Our street is continually obstructed by vehicles double parking or parking in such a way that it leaves only a limited amount of space to access through.  More often than not there is little or no chance of an emergency vehicle fitting through, and tonight I placed a note on a vehicle advising of such, as only enough space was left to just squeeze a transit van through. Then I watched the driver and passengers read the note, with amusement. This was 2 middle aged women and two pension aged.  This did annoy me as I did not expect,the middle aged women to find the content so amusing bearing in mind it could be older ladies similar to the ones with them that might be in need of an emergency vehicle, on our street. The road is narrow and allows mainly only parking on one side, this being the right to ensure all residents can move freely to and from their homes, apart from the first 3 houses on the left who park on the left side as they have no other houses opposite them and therefore cause no problems, everyone passes up the road on the right then transfers onto the left where the next row of houses start on the right and parking then changes to the right hand side of the road.  All the residents are very considerate to each other, and problems only occur during the opening hours of Mama Mias Restaurant when all the customers seem to take it upon themselve to either block/obstruct vision on Market Street to the right, for residents trying to exit Moorfield Terrace, or others create real problems, on the Terrace, with their bad parking habits, leaving  residents continually having to squeeze through the smallest of spaces left by them. Also on a regular basis the problems spills into the following morning or day as many people who drive intending not to drink, appear to change their mind then leave their vehicles overnight, returning for them the following morning or later.  I feel we would benefit greatly from a Residents Parking only zone, and the limited length and width of our street would no longer be a problem to us.  Please can you advise if this would be possible?  And if this is a viable option, what steps we would need to take to put this system in place.

The junction of Grahams Road, Falkirk, and Dalderse Avenue, Falkirk is dangerous. It is a pelican crossing but the traffic lights are so badly set that traffic entering the crossing is snarled up and the pedestrian crossing is often blocked when the lights are for pedestrians.
Falkirk Council have been told about this, and photos sent in, but the crossing is still dangerous. Many local residents are elderly and disabled and are frightened to cross the road. One elderly, lady who has to use two walking sticks, won't cross the road unless she is with her daughter.
The manager in charge, Findlay Brown, has agreed with a pensioner resident that someone will have to be killed or injured before something is done! This is true. We have been trying to get the council to do something for more than a year.",

Back in March, British Gas were running pipelines down Brandon Terrace. Further south, they generally filled the holes in after they left. At the Gelnogle Road junction and down to Canonmills, however, they simply abandoned the work uncompleted. No work has been done and no workman has been seen for two months; Glenogle Road remains blocked as does two lanes in Brandon Place. The signs say the blockage is for 6 weeks from 12 March, although workmen went off site long before the end of that period. CLARENCE told me, unbelievably, they had been told there was a gas leak there and that gas contractors were returning every now and then to see if they could still mell gas!! They also tell me that so far as they are concerned the Gas Board is entitled to abandon work for up to three months at a time which if true is pretty idle.Meanwhile there are constant traffic blocks, the Stockbridge Colonies are cut off, and there is a gigantic eyesore.",

Some time ago the Council built a new path westwards from the footbridge, and more recently constructed a flight of steps to join up to the old path. A few weeks ago this was comprehensively vandalised and is totally unuseable (though mountain bikers do go down the earth slope where the steps used to be). I don't know if the vandalism was official or unoffical- if the former, could this not be planted to its original wild state; if the latter, could this pleasant path not be reinstated? ",

Rehoboth Road seems to suffer from an acute sense of 'neighbours worrying about cars parking on the road or grass verge outside their house'. Their solution is to place boulders right on the edge of the road to prevent any vehicle 'incursion'. The grass verge is part of the legal highway. Not only do pedestrians have to weave their way around these obstructions but they are unsightly and god only knows what damage these rocks could do if a car were forced slightly off the highway. I realise that people have developed a sense of 'ownership' over these sections of 'road' and some are beautifully manicured but please could we dispense with the rockeries in the interests of safety, visual amenity and plain common-sense!",

The alley way between Rosemary Avenue and Broadstairs Road requires an Inspection as the amount of litter is disgusting. Somebody needs to address this problem with the school in the area and Network Rail. This problem also affects parts of Rosemary Avenue. In the past when I have contacted TDC about Rosemary Ave' a road sweeper is sent around but basically it is an on-going problem and should not be addressed only when it is brought to your attention. What has happened to Keep Broadstairs Beautiful? Or does that only apply to areas which are seen by visitors and officials?",

Once again the road surface outside the Egger factory has deteriorated to a point which causes vehicles passing the entrance to shudder violently and is now unavoidable.  The constant poor state of this road surface warrants a complete overhaul of the substructure of the road and a completely new top surface.  This road has been in this state for some years and is frequently the subject of poor quality patching which usually only lasts for a week or two before it wears out.",

On numerous occassions it has been reported that there are a number of dogs defecating in the alley between Alston Street and Leyburn Street. (I myself have phoned, my in-laws from Alston Street have complained and we have been informed other neighbours have complained too and all of us have said the same dog owners). When I phoned to report,I was informed that the waste would be removed that same day, but the waste still sits there. There is now more dog faeces in the alley and nothing seems to be getting done. There are signs attatched to the alleygates reference dog fouling and a fine of £50, but how can the fines be issued when there is no-one from the council monitoring or taking note of the complaints? All we want is a clean alley. There are children who play in the alley and who are at risk not only from being blinded due to the faeces, but as one of the dogs is a pitbull, it's temperament is unknown, and therefore classed as a danger. Besides the above it's not nice to be surrounded by dog faeces. I myself am a dog owner and I often run my dog in the alley, but he does his business in my back yard or my in-laws, never in the alley. The question a few of us would like answering is why are these dogs being allowed into the alley to do their business, when all the properties have yards? If these people insist on allowing their dogs into the alley to dirty, then why don't they take responsibility and clean up after their dogs? Something has to be done! ",

Trees on Willow Vale grow large fruit which when ripe, drop to the pavement and onto the walls, window panes and front yard of several properties. These fruit then rot leaving a thick, sticky paste which is not only very difficult to remove but also stains the walls of the property and quite probably erodes the brickwork due to acidic nature of the fruit as it breaks down. Can the council clean up all the fruit that is dropped or perhaps pay for the cleaning, painting and rendering work that will inevitably have to be done.

It has been noticed that the person living at [edited for privacy - details sent to council] allows his dog to roam freely around the estate at approximately 11pm very night without the owner being present. The purpose of letting the dog out is of cause to allow the dog to move its bowls. The owner is not in the slightest bit bothered that the dog is fouling on every ones front lawn. If he was bothered he'd let the dog off in his own back garden or pick up the mess. It has also been noticed that he does not pickup his dogs fouling within the village of Dalston. Please help!

One of the block doors had been forced open and a solitary double mattress was inside (possible squatter?). I was told that a locksmith would be sent out to look at the problem. This has not yet been retified and the adjacent shed door, which appears to be still locked, has had a number of its wooden door slats broken/removed. This has left me very concerned about the safety of mine & others belongings, if any, in our respective out houses.

There is a huge mass of water outside our house, right infront of our driveway and the bus stop just before Plexfield Rd.
People are getting absolutely soaked at the bus stop, and it causes havoc whilst people are walking by, they all have to come right upon the grass to try and escape the water spray from cars etc., it is also annoying as people are now standing on our driveway to avoid the puddle, which causes problems when we need to turn in off the main Bilton Rd, which is ( as you know ) always busy.
It is also dangerous for the lorries coming around the bend from Bilton village, as they suddenly see the flood and try and hit their breaks.
A house opposite us has already had a lorry go through their front railings, and what a mess it's made too.
A poor School boy got soaked this morning whilst waiting for the bus, and a lady with 2 children and a buggy was having great difficulty trying to ' time ' her run past the bus stop so that she didn't get soaked from the spray of vehicles going by.
This happens EVERYTIME that it rains, and seems to be spreading further each time, it really is starting at the corner of Beech Drive and then continuing down to Plexfield.
We saw a lovely couple get soaked last night too, who, obviously had their night ruined ! and ended up shouting and swearing at the car driver.

Ever since Barnsley hospital made the decision to become 'smoke free' there has been an increasing number of people standing on the boundries of the hospital smoking,eg on Pogmoor Road and Gawber Road,this has led to there being a significant number of cigarette ends just being thrown on the floor.I would like to know who is responsible for cleaning this up it is absolutely disgusting that there is nobody taking responsibilty for it. I live on Pogmoor Road and apart from the fact seeing someone in their pygamas smoking on the street is outrages this is littering and something they can be fined £80 for i believe.Thankyou for your time and i would love for this to be resolved ",

Many residents enjoy a walk around to Pinkneys Green from the Cranbrook Drive area.  The Speed limit for Furze Platt road near Pinkneys Farm is 40MPH, however, the majority of motorists ignore this and due to the pavement being very narrow and the road being on a bend, it is very dangerous for pedestrians.  Could the speed limit be reduced to 30MPH? Could road humps be introduced? Or does this have to wait for a fatality?",

Gradually all our nice paved footpaths are dissapearing under a very sub-standard coating of tarmac or concrete. The pavements have been lifted to lay or repair underground pipes or cables and after the job has been finished the path is NOT replaced as it had been. Instead we get a cheap layer of tarmac or concrete. What happens to the paving slabs - probably sold off for some cash in pocket I would guess. The paving at the start of The Larches has recently dissappeared to be replaced by tarmac. The finish here may be smooth but it looks cheap and nasty. When it is dug up again it will no doubt be repaired with another surface that is guaranteed not to match and will be probably be uneven. look at the drop kerbs that home owners are charged for, these are hideous with usually two or three repair patches running through them.It is about time that the contractors digging up the area were made to return the area to its former state.

Durin the recent gas works done in Upper Hale road trenches were dug and then re surfaced.These trenches have been slowly sinking and have now sunk to such an extent that when large lorries hit this hole the foundations of our house shake. We have always had problems with shakes when HGV's pass the house, but now with this sunken trench we are having cracks appearing above doors, windows and in the walls in general.Not only is this causing damage to our house but I believe it is a dangerous situation in the road.",

The garage block is owned by the residents of numbers 11 to 18, but it is not fair to expect them to cover the cost of repair to damage caused by contractors. Because the wall has been damaged for some time now many people  climb through the hole as a shortcut when coming from the Hotel on the Tushmore Roundabout or from Langley Green itself.

The pavement outside the said dwelling and local vacinity is in extremely poor repair. It is pitted and holey. We had a skimmed layer of ashfelt applied to the top of the original paving many years ago and that has been the total of maintenance in over 30 years. The dropped curb crossing has been insitu for over 20 years is breaking up with large gaps and loose ashfelt apparent. In the summer when we experience hot weather the surface melts and in the winter it doesn't do very well in the freezing temperatures. It was only ever a fine ashfelt layer and is in desperate need of a full re-surface repair under what could be considered 'health and safety issues'. It is a main public crossing point and the majority of deliveries to the flats within the culde sac are done from that point. The same applies when ambulances attend.We are aware that other roads in the vacinity under the NG5 coding have had their pavements and roads re-surfaces on quite a few occasions. Please could it be inspected with the view of either a good repair or re-surfacing of the pavements in the vacinity. Thankyou. ",

Although there are clearly marked parking restrictions on this road and the raod outside the Friary Pub it seems that they are not enforced. Even though vehicles park causing obstructions to the entrance to Lunar Rise. It would appear that in both these roads it is ok to park without fear of a ticket as a number of vehicles regularly park there day and night. I have asked the Council three times what the status of these roads are and if it is ok to park there and have yet to recieve a response. So it would appear that it is ok to park in both these roads. Maybe they will respond to this latest query??? ",

On the grassed area in front and behind my flat are areas of grassed courtyard. These areas are used by persons from the surrounding area as a dog toilet. I have over the last six months never witnessed any of these persons removing the excrement. Fellow tenents in this close have spoken with me about this problem and have advised me that they have, when approaching the some owners of these dogs, been threatened with violence.

The council has recently made the hill two-way traffic for part of the hill which was a one-way street and is now a cul-de-sac. The one-way section, which is ignored by motorists, does not deter its use a rat run. Pedestrians are put at risk from vehicles trying to pass on its narrow width.",

On the corner as the road comes down the hill towards my house (1, Oak Avenue), the kerb blends lowers than the pavement. When we have rain, the water flows down the road, over the pavement and down the front steps to my property where our drain has now become blocked as a result and also the water doesn't flow away flooding the front of our property.  The kerb needs raising on the corner to match the rest of the street in front of our house and also our drain on our property needs unblocking so that water can pass down it again",

Properties on the west side of Plough Road are continually flooded whenever there is heavy rain. The problem stems from 1)continually blocked drains in Plough Road, the High Street and Hollow Lane and 2). The insuffient height of the kerb edge blocks due to road resurfacing by the council. We the residence first contacted the council about this problem September 2006. We have identified the problem for them and we have told them the solution i.e. raise the kerb edge stones by the affected houses and clean the drains properly. But they continue to ignore us and have even suggested we are making it up or are mistaken. It may be that the drains are inadequate and that is why they continue to get blocked. Another very serious problem is that  manhole cover in Hollow Lane gets blown off with the force of the water and it is only a matter of time before there is a serious accident as it comes off every time there is a heavy shower.",

A sign probably some 25 yrs old and now leaning badly reads ""Bretton Centre/ Rightwell"" with left turn arrow.
In fact the left turn is into Flaxland, the ""street"" of Bretton Park Playing Fields, Sainsburys and Bretton Woods School (BWS soon to be replaced I understand by housing and more shops).
There probably needs to be some indication of Flaxland, which does not feature on the larger recent signboard and will be needed in addresses present and future,but first of all this old sign must be removed. Its presence gives an excuse to the frequent vehicles passing the ""no motor vehicles except buses"" signs which protect the bus lane in the Bretton Centre. Rightwell is the address of the Cresset, numerous offices and shops etc.
(I told the Council of this some 5 years ago... the incorrect sign still stands - but only just!)",

The road at the junction of Ledborough Lane and Sandelswood End (heading south) seems to have subsided and pothole has developed.

The area outside the shops has become a very unpleasant place in the evening.

This behaviour is being encoured by certain members of staff at taylors off-licence who are more than happy to serve alcohol to underage teens. This area would greatly benefit from new litter bins as the old ones are quite small and often over-flowing.  Also CCTV would be a good idea to stop drug dealing from cars.",

[edited for privacy - details sent to council] are having a good summer and it's miserable for the rest of us. Today was just the latest noise-related episode -- band practice onmor the roof started at 1.30 today (Sunday  22nd July) and didn't finish until we started shouting at them to stop at around 6pm. The music (guitar and drums) was amplified - you could hear it at Dalston Junction. When we complained, the residents of [edited for privacy - details sent to council] were extremely abusive.

We live in a set of flats above the estate agents on Lower Bridge Street called Unity Passage. The problem we have is that there is a public throughfare right outside the enterance to our flats leading to the public carpark off of Albion Street. We have always had a group of homeless people that tend to congregate here as it is undercover and apart from the odd beer can they have never caused any problems. However over the last few days we have noticed an increase in the number of people hanging around outside our enterance and there has been a huge increase in litter including broken bottles, cans, food and worst of all used condoms!! I think this is disgusting and highly unhigenic and would appreciate if the council could put this passageway onto it's list of streets to be cleaned as it usually falls to the hairdressers next door to do it, but I do not think it is fair that they are made to clean up items of this nature when it is after all a public throughfare.

This report is being written with the consent and approval of the occupiers of 33,34,35 and 36 Oak Close. Because both entrances to the above properties have bollards, the green facing the houses is cut with a strimmer. The ""grass"" has now grown in places over the path; in some areas up to 50%. Over the past years, the tenants have at their own expense, put weedkiller down on the path to try to eradicate the moss and weeds which are in places knee high. We feel this is no longer acceptable. The Bollards placed adjacent to 33 Oak Close serve no purpose at all. We do not have a problem with ""Biker's"", and if we did; the bollards would not be a deterent. We are unable to have large deliveries made to our homes as there is no access, but more importantly, there is no access for the emergency services which is a major concern for all occupiers. I would point out, that these bollards affect only the homeowners who are requesting their removal i.e 33,34,35 & 36 Oak Close. Finally, we would request that the ""No Ball Games"" signs were replaced on the wall facing the properties and also the wall to the side of No. 36. The original signs have over the past 2 years been removed when restoration work has been carried out by the homeowners. I would like to thank you for taking the time to read our comments, and hope that the council can resolve our issues.",

One of the residents living at [edited for privacy - details sent to council] uses the parking spaces around neighbouring houses to park his cars. These are not in good condition and usually are without road tax. Two of the current cars are an 'L' Proton and a 'w ' Registered Caravenette. (This being the first 'w' registration making the vehicle over 20 years old) The condition of the latter is appaling and it is such an eyesore when parked directly in full view of the house. At fist is was only an odd car but now he has probably 3 / 4 cars plus his breakdown truck and his own car. He has been tackled but it has just made matters worse. I have contacted the police but they are unable to act. Perhaps the council may have better look. I feel it is unfair to all the local council tax payers to have to put up with the area looking as a used car lot, and not even decent ones at that.

Its becoming an obvious eyesore here and also near the One Stop Shop & public toilet in Main Street. There are lots of wild flowering weeds visible and growing out of kerbs and around wall bases which require removal. 
Can something be done? i.e. sprayed with weedkiller to eradicate them in the long term.
Thank you",

There has been much discussion but no action about the speeding traffic through the village - it affects all including endangering children from the local school who have to walk through the village from the school to the village hall for PE and assemblies etc (there is no reduced speed limit in the village even to accommodate the school). At night we are plagued by boy racers. There are critcially no speed inhibitors; the Shiply Park road has been resurfaced so encouraging travel at speed, and some misguided sole last year increased the speed limit to West Hallam from 30 mph to 40 mph. This has no doubt encouraged the increase in through traffic which accelerates dangerously and noisily out of the village from the crossroads and decelerates while still at speed as it approaches the village crossroads. As I have said there has been much huffing and puffing by Parish Council, local authority and police but the situation is deteriorating and those responsible for the inactivity are in my judgement in danger of collective negligence    ",

I have continuing concerns about cars and commercial vans being parked obstructively opposite my house. There are no double yellow lines in Melbreck so car/van owners are parking where they like!
Commercial vehicles are blocking my access from my drive resulting in me trying to Manueovre my car several times to get out of the drive. These vans are also parking on the pavements causing severe damage to the footpath and also blocking sight lines around a corner. 
Could anything be done to stop this obstructive parking?

We have a problem with a pipe carrying drainage water from the main A49 in Bayston Hill at the point marked on the map.  Water comes from Lyth Hill down the drain and at that point flows into an open ditch in an unmaintained allotment area.  The water then flows into a pipe in our garden and eventually down into Lower Pulley Lane. We live at Rockville which is the 2nd house down the lane as shown on the map.

The grass verge opposite my house in Redburn Lane never gets cut. The grass cutting stops at the junction of Black Boy Road and Redburn Lane. The owners of the houses at Chilton Mews always cut the verge against our boundary wall, otherwise this would never get cut. The new streetlighting and resurfaced road have made a real improvement to the area but the verge and gutter is already becomoming overgrown, spoiling the effect.
The length of verge is only about 50m from Black Boy Road junction to opposite the entrance to Chilton Mews, can this not be added to your grass cutting schedules? Please advise, thanks. ",

PLEASE, PLEASE make them understand this.

1) Every year the trees in Railton Road are replaced, EVERY YEAR they are broken. This is pointless. They must have wire guards or don't bother with them at all in that location (Railton Road).

2) Wire guards are supplied when deemed necessary, some trees have guards, so put them on the trees in Railton.

I really want to scream at you! Can't you see that what is happening now is not only snail-slow but is futile. PLEASE see the daft logic in not guarding these trees with mesh.

Budget....
- one tree with guard, how much?
- a new tree every year, how much?

I arranged with the Council a day (Wednesday 1 August)to have items of rubbish uplifted from the door of [edited for privacy - details sent to council]. I was told to leave the rubbish there before 7am for an early uplift. I put the rubbish out the night before (as per instructions). When the rubbish was not uplifted by mid-morning I telephoned the Council. I was assured it ""was in the book"", it would be uplifted before 5pm, and it was now their responsibility. It was not uplifted on that specified day (August 1). In my opinion some of the items constitute a potential danger if they fall into the wrong hands and I'm very worried as I am at present away from the place.My wife phoned this morning and has been assured it will be uplifted to day (Aug.2)I sincerely hope so - but although the people we dealt with were nice and  polite I have very little confidence in the  service. I am of course a council tax payer. ",

There is a lot of dog mess all along this tarmac path that runs from St.nicholas drive through the centre of the estate at the back of Bywood and Bracken place , dymoke drive santuary way, foxhill and on to the P.O.
There are stickers on the lamp posts alone this path warning dog foulers will be find but is this area being monitored? I don't think so as there is mess every were.
My children use this root to school and apart from the smell it is unfair they have to walk around dog mess on this path and view the the piles on the grass along the path.

A dark navy 1.3 Proton car registration number M121 MMO has been left parked in the road for approximately 8 - 10 weeks (could be longer).   The car has vehicle licence in the windscreen which expired on 31 July 2007.   The car has a smashed windscreen and have just noticed as of today (14th August 2007) that the driver's window has now been smashed - resulting in glass being spread over the road; as well as this, the petrol cap has been removed and aerial bent over the roof.  There is glass and debris inside the car. This car appears to have been abandoned and is gradually being smashed up to the detriment of the environment.  We would appreciate it being looked at and something actioned with this, the area needs to be kept tidy and orderly to maintain a pleasant environment.
Thank you.",

Hi
There are fairly consistantly people using the Malcolm X carpark for intravenous drug use. In particular they go behind the plastic recyling container and on the step at the back ( fire escape?) next to the convent on the Ashley Road side. What worries me about this is that they are extremely open about it, and families etc live in this area, there is obviously the issue of used needles aswell. They are not  people using the Malcolm X for activities they are just people who are using these quite concealed areas for drug use. ",

The school crossing on this VERY busy road has almost no safety provision.  By compairson to nearby Garrett Hall school which is awash with safety features.  Why is St johns being neglected? Recent pink tarmac added seems to be for the convenience of would be residents in the new housing development. How this this be a higher priority than primary school children (including my own) and the lollipop lady who has to step out into this road over forty times every day? That's 200 times per week.  That's 7600 times per year. Surely she deserves the same safety provision as the chap at Garrett Hall school? I'm sure it is nothing to do with gender discrimination. Is it? Or some kind of reflection on St Johns status as a church school? Surely not.",

I live on a quiet road with lots of children who enjoy playing in the street, however recently i have noticed an increase in the amount of dog fouling on the grassy areas on the curb. Much to my annoyance i happened to tread in such fouling and walked it through my house, i can only imagine that the the young children that play in the street have done the same, worse still got it on other areas which could potentially cause a nasty heath problem. After this incident i saw a irresponsible dog owner who regulary walks her dog down our road as she lives on the corner of Norton Road and Lynton Road with her dog that happily went to the toilet on the grass as dogs do but the owner just walked away without clearing up the feaces. There are other dog owners in our street and surrounding area who are responsible dog owners and clean up after their dogs. What can you do to help this problem?",

When I got to the barn I could see that he had dumped a load of household rubbish including 4 dining room 'rattan' style chairs, a number of bags of rubbish and games and other general rubbish.  I can state that this was dumped  by this man as I had passed that way walking my dogs not 20 mins before and this rubbish had not been there.  I could hear the scraping as he dragged stuff out of his van as this noise led to investigate what was going on.",

Located in a passing place on a road only wide enough for one vehicle. On the right hand side facing towards Horncastle Rd. There are 5 potholes measuring up to 6inches deep which passing vehicles are forced to drive over. This has caused considerable damage to our vehicle and undoubtedly many others. In addition to this the aggressive jolt in the car has also seriously aggravated a back injury. The potholes have been there for at least 2 years, and despite road works being carried out only metres away at the level crossing, the deteriorating pot holes and road surface of Red Cap Lane have continued to be ignored and this frequently used passing place is in urgent need of attention. I have taken photographs as a personal record to monitor progress, as so far this has resulted in several new tyres and possibly new alloys as they have been damaged. I look forward to your reply.

4 street lights (PCC01 to PCC04) have not been working since September 2006 this despite the strenuous effort and calls to the Council from ward councillors and local residents. The fact that it has something to do with works carried out on the nearby A47 by Cambridgeshire County Council and it's contractors cannot be good reason why these lights have not worked for so long. Additionally the 4 columns [without lamps] that were installed to light the footbridge over the A47 also need urgent attention particularly as the winter (& darker nights) approach.
Your urgent attention to this matter will be much appreciated by local residents.

The pyracantha bushes directly opposite the front entrances to numbers 16 to 19 Howland are severely restricting access. It is impossible to safely use buggy, never mind a double buggy, as the 'spikey' bushes are at head height of any child in the buggy and would present a serious safety issue. It is also extremely problematic, nigh on impossible navigating a wheelchair along the same footpath. It is the ONLY access to these front doors. Whilst efforts are made to trim these shrubs by the residents themselves(a neccessity, as along with the brambles they grow at an alarming rate and are clearly dangerous)it is not enough, these shrubs need removing completely! A single slab pathway is not sufficient!
Incidentally one of the access pathways down the side of the car park is almost completely blocked by the same downright anti-social shrubs! Apologies for being so forthright however having to negotiate the offending shrubs with my 17 month son, with another child on the way, I am understandably annoyed. ",

I've absolutely no problem with this at all, it is part and parcel of living in a rural area.  The stench this evening takes this to a completely new level.  It is like sitting in the middle of a sewage works.  You've no chance of sitting outside  and the stench is gradualy creeping through the house.  I understand that the farmer(s) concerned was granted a license for handling human waste.

Well where to begin....
1)New Road has since 28.08.07 become partially a one way system from the Oundle Rd intersection along New Rd to Orton Ave. Problem alot of motorists are ignoring the No Entry signs and driving up New Rd toward Oundle Rd, this is dangerous as traffic coming from Oundle Rd are asuming that being one way they will meet no other traffic.soon an accident will happen. 2) if driving along Orton Avenue toward New Rd you are not aware that at that junction you can only go right toward London Rd and NOT left into New Rd, suggestion - council to put at junction a NO left turn sign.
3)TRAFFIC TOO FAST ALONG NEW RD - suggest 20mph signs.4)Next week school resumes and New Rd will be again used by parents and their cars dropping kids to school and using walkway thru to Brewster Ave school, they need to be made aware of the change in direction in New Rd. 5) More No Entry signs are needed to make motorists aware of this alteration to New Rd and Oundle Rd restrictions.

There are 3 problems that I have put up with for as long as I have been able but something needs to be done.
1. Dog fouling - There are a number of houses in the area with dogs. Some of the dogs are free to walk around and make a mess where ever they like and the owners dont clean the mess up. I have had dog's mess in my garden on numerous occassions, which is totally unexceptable.
2. Litter - A lot of households also put there rubbish out for collection far to early and wildlife then scatters it everywhere causing litter to be all over the streets  but occupants of these houses dont pick it up.
3. There are no speed limit signs around the estates so vehicle divers think its a racing track and they come around the estate far to fast.

The edging and surface on the inside of the angle (behind a cover) are badly sunk. The turn is also too sharply angled to be satisfactory as a cycle route, which it has been on City Council maps since 1991. It is well used by both pedestrians and cyclists, being an important access between residential area and local commercial centre.",

In the alleyway next to belgrave social club and on the grass verge where the green electric box is situated (at the beginning of the alleyway off wilnecote lane), there is an excess of beer cans/litter and a high amount of shatterd glass. The whole of the alleyway needs de weeding and a litter machine to get all of the shattered pieces of glass safely removed and the litter picked up.  The phone box which now has shatterproof glass in still has the glass on the floor from when it got smashed months and months ago.  This problem has been reported to street team but they just come and pick up the litter and do not tough the glass or alleyway and that can take a long period of time for them to come out.  As this is a problem area for litter and glass due to a shop and chip shop being yards away it should be done on a daily basis.  The alleyway is used by parents taking their children to school plus kids drinking in it and using it as a social hang out.  The litter is bad enough as you walk down there but my dog had to go and have glass removed from his paw AFTER this problem was reported by my neighbour.",

This is a fairly new estblishment, and people are moving in all the time. Unfortunately the number of residents is increasing but the number of bins provided is not. At the moment the bins are overflowing with rubbish, which is consequently left to blow around the court yard, smell, and attract rodents. It is not attractive and does not smell particularly pleasant.
Would you be kind enough to either provide more bins or empty them on a more regular basis, as the present problem is not one that can be ignored.
This photo was taken just 2 days after the bins had been emptied!!",

Beech Grove is a narrow street and often children are playing at this time along with irregular parked cars (belonging to residents of Beech Grove).

The lower section of school brae is blocked on a daily basis with people paring where the road is narrow. This is our only access and egress from our home and often have to knock doors to find drivers , some of the drivers are in the town shopping and we have to wait on them. twice in the past week delivery vehicles to our home have abandoned trying to deliver !!The bucket lorry has also on occasion left without emptying our bin because of poorly parked cars. Either the yellow lines need extending or additional spaces need to be introduced.
Attached one photo which actually shows two cars blocking the brae.  I will take photo's over the next week to show how bad the problem is.  Our worst fear is if a Fire engine required access it would not get past. many thanks",

Don't dog owners realise that children can catch some nasty diseases from dog poo?  This is all happening on a major walking route to a primary school.  Something needs to be done quickly.

I volunteer for Great Yarmouth's Street Scene. When I surveyed on the alleyway, I met two elderly residents who both have motorized scooters.  The only access they have to get their scooters in and out of their property is this alleyway.  Because of the terrible condition of this alleyway, they are forced to back their scooters onto the embankment to get in and out.  The alleyway is full of flytipping, there are potholes all over, and the embankment is forever growing.  I believe this will one day force the elderly residents to either have their scooters overturn, or they will become housebound. I believe that the whole length of the alleyway behind these properties should be concreted, so that the residents can safely enter and leave their properties.",

The bin sites belong to these properties in Sunflower Way. The rubbish has been there for some months and I think it was left by ex tennants, I don't think the new tennants know it is their rubbish area as they seem to put their rubbish in the regular rubbish collection point. This rubbish is not by the electric meter cupboards as this is the rubbish area for 7 & 8 Aubrietia, it is in between the gardens at the back of 8 Aubrietia and property in Sunflower Way.

During the last 6 months there has been a consistent problem with dog fouling in the lane at the back of our property. On occasions there has also been fouling on our property (adjacent to lane). We have invested in cat and dog repellers but these seem ineffective. As there are several children in this area that play in the lane i feel that there should be more signs about fouling and keeping dogs on leads and more bins provided. ",

This farmer ,who farms Blackslack, admits that the lane was made for old grey Freie size tractors and not many of them at that.The previous farmer did the lot with two small Ford tractorsand did no or little harm  to the lane surface.The constant pounding by the massive Fastrck tractors and very large lorries has largely destroyed the normal passage of this lane .It was used quite a lot by local car traffic but not now ,suspension has been damaged on vehicles coming past here.",

The verges and hedges along old ashford road never get cut during the Spring or Summer and as a consequence the visibility from my house ""Lanrig"" which is just on the bend on the same side as marked is dangerous.   Because there are no speed restrictions I am frequently in danger as I or my wife cross the road on foot to then see myself out in the car.   As this is the usual road for visitors from abroad to approach our village it gives a very bad impression regarding standard of upkeep (please come and see for yourself).",

However, I believe that if more local people were aware of this website, more reports of problem families and problem areas might be made.

I began cycling along this lane when i was 13. I am now 33. It has never been resurfaced. It is dangerous to ride road bikes on because it is so uneven, and has frequently damaged tyres, inner tubes and wheels. It is now so bad that at any speed a cyclist on a standard road bike, or even motorbike could be thrown off. Ironically it is signposted as part of the councils round the island cycle route.When is it due for resurfacing?",

These have been painted either side of the entrance to Drudge Road from Upper Cliff Road and at the exit onto Englands Lane and where it crosses Lower Cliff Road effectively removing 8 parking spaces in an area with acute parking problems. This action appears to be the easy option as a little thought would have come up with the obvious answer which is to make Drudge Road one way in the opposite direction to the one way Cliff Hill direction. In actual fact, bearing in mind that the Highways Department has refused to provide any kind of speed reduction facilities along Riverside Road, even though a child was actually knocked over by a car there only a couple of years ago,and noting that in the 13 years I have lived in Upper Cliff Road there has never been any kind of accident or even near miss in Drudge Road, there does seem to be some kind of inconsistancy working here. Finally, the Highways Department claim that local residents had been consulted before action was taken, which it most certainly was not.",

I am a disabled homeowner residing at [edited for privacy - details sent to council]. There is a partial Public footpath/steps that I use to access my Private Driveway. Many people use this footpath and the three steps are very unsafe and broken, the footpath ends at steps because of trees etc,resulting in many members of the public  having to use my private drive.  
I must emphasise the risk primarily to myself and members of the community due to the crumbling steps, is very high. I also use crutches and suffer from a neurological disorder, so this poses as a safety hazzard to myself. My driveway is also being damaged by people using it on a daily basis because the pathway does not continue to the street, it ends prematurly at my driveway. I would appreciate it if you could treat this matter with some urgency as it is becoming too unsafe for me to use and I have to be able to access my driveway/car.

About a year ago, a vast amount of old astro turf was dumped at this location. This year it has become a favourite spot for a group of youngsters to 'hang out' on a regular basis, even until the early hours of the morning. The rolls are now strewn with litter, including empty cigarette packets and dog ends (some of which look like spliffs). Old barbecue trays can also be found nearby.
The dumping of this material has thus led to noise into the early hours and the possibility of a fire hazard. The material looks highly inflammable and if it does go up, so will our fences! 
If the County Council arranged for the rolls to be dumped, it seems an extraordinary way for a body responsible for waste management to deal with its own problems. It has led to a fire hazard, noise nuisance and public order issues on Council land.",

Lancashire County Council has a 50mph speed allowed on this road and it is ridiculous. I have flagged three spots on the map. There have been accidents here in the past, including fatal and serious injuries. Further down the road there are to be traffic lights installed to attempt to control the number one traffic hotspot in Chorley. On leaving those traffic lights we believe the speed limit should be restricted to 30mph up to the existing 30mph limit at Higher Wheelton and beyond.  The crossroads at Victoria Street and opposite simply cannot operate safely with a 50 mph on the road - it is too fast and, as it is well known, people who are allowed to do 50 will do in excess of it and there have been several incidents of heavy braking and horn blowing etc within the last 48 hours.  There are several people now wishing to contact the council and actively seek their assistance in this traffic safety issue.  They have demonstrated their cooperation recently in other surrounding villages and hope that, when the traffic lights are installed at ""Bump Junction"" they will also impose a sensible limit of 30 mph on this road.

On the junction of Brownley Road and Altrincham Road by j.2 of the M56, on several evenings in the past few months, I have been subjected to an attack by youths throwing stones and rocks while I walking past on the pavement on the opposite side of the road.  This has occured after dark, between 6pm and 9pm and sometimes the male youths, who try to hide themeselves from view in the shrubs, also throw plants on to the road. Twice a stone has only missed injuring me because it hit the metal railings placed on the roundabout to protect pedestrians from cars. The latest incident was at approx. 8:30pm last night when I was walking southwards along Brownley Road with my partner, we could see 3 youths and the attack continued until we reached the junction with Freshpool Way. It's very frightening and dangerous. Perhaps if the police are unable to do anything about this, remove the low lying shrubs the youths use as cover?",

At the front of our property is a council owned grass verge which runs parellel to the pavement which half of this is seperated by a council steel fence the other half is not.When dog owners are passing they let there dogs excrete on this grass and do not pick it up, this is a dangerous and often dirty situation as many of the people who live around the verge use it to cut to there houses and also have  children playing here.On the 23/9/07 i noticed the owner of a chocolate labrador walk right passed his dog as it excreted on the grass verge,after seeing the man totally ignore what his dog had done i confonted him and asked him if he intended to pick his dogs mess up, where he said no and his response was he did it there all the time,this gentlemans behaviour was irresponsible and ignorant .this gentleman lives at number 646 beechley drive i hope you can fine him accordingly,thanks mr p d conway",

There seems to be an ever increasing number of cars parked on purser way above kelly driveon the left hand side and,  you have to drive around them to turn right into Johnson Avenue and into oncoming traffic coming down the other way on what is their right side of the road. It won't be too long before this causes an accident as my self and my wife have had a few near misses with cars coming down and are turning left into Purser way, who cannot see you until they come around the corner. It could be the university or the police station who both seem to have a lack of parking but this is cleary a dangerous situation.  ",

Argyle Street is a one way street but this is poorly signposted. A new sign should be positioned opposite (but slightly down from) the entrance to the ASH Co-op car park on Argyle St by the railway bridge, a new one should be put at the top of Argyle Street (junction with Mill Rd), and there should be one at the bottom of the railway bridge (as if one were about to turn into Argyle Street from Mill Rd). Also, the one opposite the entrance to Fletchers Terrace needs replacing as it is faded. As well as the motorists who ignore/don't see the one way signs, there are many cyclists who do too. I would therefore like to see a sign highlighting that the street is one way for cyclists as well. I telephoned the City Council in April, May and July but have as yet had no response. Your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated, especially as I have borne witness to several near accidents in the area recently.",

The council should at least lie and say that over 100 people this year have been fined for letting their dog shit on the pavement. Alternative fixes could be
1. Anyone found walking more than 50 yards ahead of their dog off its lead should be fined.
2. Checks on people walking dogs to see if they have bags to pick it up with.
3. Spy cameras.
4. You guys could set up a website where people who see people not picking up their dogs shit could send videos to which the site could publish. I.e if somebody see's a dog doing it's stuff they take a video on their phone, they then follow the dog home and show the street name and house number. Then when people found D.S. on the street they could post it through that persons letter box.
I know that some of these are extreme measures but something needs to be done. I've tried writing to the local mp but theirs no response.",

I wrote a complaint back in June - since then, the situation is even
worse - the bad area is Glencoe Road, as you walk up to the bollard
from Upper Bridge street and carry on along past number 19 Glencoe
Road.  It might only be one dog and owner who are causing the problem, but it's getting really bad and now that the evenings are getting darker, you can't avoid treading in it.

 I'm more than happy for the council to attach signs to my wall to
remind people of the penalty or put up a dog poo bin but it really is making my life very difficult with the constant cleaning of shoes, carpets etc.

As a result we have had 2 instances in just over a week of horses fouling this path.  I have two small children which I walk up to school along this path and it is getting increasingly difficult to stop them standing in this horse muck.  As you can imagine, it is not acceptable to send the children into the classroom in shoes covered in horse muck!  Also I have a baby and it is impossible to stay on the tarmac path and avoid wheeling the pushchair through the muck.  She will be walking in a few months and I want to be able to let her walk some of the way.  This should be a safe place for her to walk, but it will not be if she is going to be running the risk of walking through and tripping up into piles of horse muck!

For about a quarter mile either side of this junction there are large patches of missing tarmac (particularly on the southbound side)and wheel-trapping holes hidden by  the white lines.  Earlier repairs on the southern side of the junction are smooth and very slippery in wet weather which combined with the off-camber makes it a lethal spot for motorcylists in particular.",

A tennant of Devonshire Street has previously painted a disabled space on the road, in my belief to guarantee a parking space.

Anyway, the council removed the markings around a month ago, but they have just been re-painted on.  As this road is not residential parking, many people park on the road & are unsure if the space is legitimate.  Therefore, it is unfair to everybody else who may park on the road.

Children, parents with buggys find it difficult to navigate around.  I am constantly looking out for Dogs mess in this area and now with the leaves falling it is more and more difficult to spot.  If only the dog owners responsible could see how easy it is for a child to step in and not realise. Then enter school, where the younger children usually spend a lot of time sitting on the carpet. If a child gets dogs mess on their hands it can seriously harm them.

Rowdy youths hang around here much of the time drinking alcohol and leaving empty cans and broken bottles.
 Young children use this as a thoroughfare to  school and it is only a matter of time before a child is badly injured on this debris. I have reported this problem to the council in the past. 
  The police are currently involved with  trying to solve youth disorder problems at this location.  
    If the council could somehow manage to keep this area free from their alcoholic debris it may help to lessen the problem. It is probably easier for one youth to self justify throwing an empty bottle onto a pile of others , rather than to throw the first.

The situation is deteriorating with regard to groups of youths spilling out from Union Street into Church Lane - there are frequently groups of teenagers drinking and smoking drugs at the back of the Royal Victoria Arcade but they are seated behind the wall to avoid detection. Moreover, there are groups who are very drunk shouting and fighting in the early hours. On Saturday 6th October a group of around 10 youths were fighting at 2.30am and one ended up holding another by the throat against the window of a house. A police car finally arrived but only shone headlights onto the group and slowly drove up the road to encourage them to disperse. Needless to say the youths returned within about 5  minutes to continue the fracas. With the 24 hour licencing laws combined with a smoking ban such people have been forced further into the streets. This antisocial behaviour is becoming too frequent and the residents feel that the police need to make a REGULAR patrols around Union St, Church Lane and the local vicinity to stop this continuing. The community is being damaged along with property and tourists are unlikely to wish to traverse through a street the following day that is filled with vomit, broken bottles and used condoms. Although this may be seen as a police matter, I believe that the Council need to be the ones to urge the police to do patrols.  Individual householders can only call the police when activity is in progress and by the time the police arrive it is invariably too late. The safety of the streets is as much the responsibility of the council as it is the police force. ",
